Notes: '"Perhaps written by William, or alternatively he was the author of the paraphrase
  of the Psalms: colophon: ''Willelme ki me escrit / Seit de deu beneit / Kil nul
  a rachete. Est li doint la grace. Kil maigne vant la face kant sera trepasse'' (f.
  215r)"; "? Cardinal Ottobuono Fieschi (d. 1276), Papal Legate to England (1265-1268),
  elected Pope as Adrian V in 1276: according to Turner the entries in the calendar
  for the Apparition of St Michael and St Agatha, venerated in southern Italy, both
  written in gold might suggest a patron with Italian interests; the now detached
  leaf (Add. MS 54215) includes an image of an ecclesiastic wearing a mitre and a
  cope (without a pallium or crosier) and identified by Turner as possible portrait
  of Cardinal Fieschi (see Turner Rediscovered Miniatures (1969))."'
