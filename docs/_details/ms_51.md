Notes: '"The unique copy in this manuscript, probably dating to c. 1400, was made
  not long after the date of the original text''s completion and, since the early
  fifteenth century, has been bound with a late fourteenth-century copy of the Algorism,
  a verse and prose treatise on mathematics in Anglo-Norman and English. "; "the manuscript
  was almost certainly in the hands of Gerald FitzGerard, Earl of Kildare (d. 1534)
  and may have come to that family from a descendant of the work''s original author.
  It was subsequently acquired by the historian John Bale (1495-1563), during his
  brief tenure as bishop of Ossory in 1552, and probably came to Parker from Bale''s
  collection."'
