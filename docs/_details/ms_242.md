Notes: '"Carefully copied by a single scribe at the end of the 13th century in England,
  this manuscript was given to Sir Thomas Phillipps by Sir Robert Benson (1797-1844).
  Benson claimed it had belonged to Wilton Abbey, in Wiltshire, where its readership
  would have been noble women and nuns."'
