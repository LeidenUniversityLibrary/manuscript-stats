Notes: checked by KAM; the Anglo-Norman material at the end may have circulated separately;
  Dean states that "La petite philosophie" (Dean no 325) is on ff. 128v-146v but these
  folia are partly missing from the MS in 2018 (this does not seem to be a recent
  loss); Dean no. 325 is not mentioned in the James Catalogue either
