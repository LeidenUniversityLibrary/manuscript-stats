Notes: 'Giles de Bridport (d. 1262), bishop of Salisbury: supposedly gave the manuscript
  to Abingdon Abbey, as recorded in a 14th-century inscription on f. 57v (see Catalogue
  of Additions 1931-1935 (1967)); see, however, Morgan, Early Gothic Manuscripts (1988),
  where Giles''s ownership is disputed, and a slightly later date (c 1270-1275) is
  proposed for the manuscript. While the inscription is no longer legible to the naked
  eye on f. 57v, an ultra-violet photograph is printed on f. ix recto.; Joan of the
  Tower (b. 1321, d. 1362), queen of Scots, consort of David II: received the manuscript
  on loan from Abingdon Abbey in 1362, according to the inscription on f. 4v and it
  may not have been returned after her death (Morgan, Early Gothic Manuscripts (1988)):
  inscription on f. 4v.'
