Notes: "\"The abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, dated ?1280: inscribed 'anno octog[esimo]',\
  \ (f. 64) and with a 15th-century ownership inscription 'Iste liber est de thesauraria\
  \ montis' (f. 1).\nJaques Cujas, humanist scholar and legal expert (b. 1529, d.\
  \ 1590), perhaps taken by him, as authorised by Nicolas le Fevre on behalf of Louis\
  \ XIII, from the abbey library in c.1582 (see Genevieve Nortier, Les bibliotheques\
  \ m\xE9di\xE9vales des abbayes b\xE9n\xE9dictines de Normandie (Caen: Caron et cie,\
  \ 1966), p. 151); his books were dispersed at his death and this manuscript may\
  \ have returned to the abbey then.\""
