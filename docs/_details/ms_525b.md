Notes: 'composite MS; whole MS: "Possibly from the Benedictine cathedral priory of
  Durham (Wright, Fontes Harleiani, 1972, p. 142): a 15th-century inscription on f.
  104r refers to donations from ''priore'', and various locations in Yorkshire and
  Durham: ''gisbouru'' (Guisborough, North Yorkshire), ''pocklyngton'' (Pocklington,
  East Yorkshire) and ''wessyngton'' (Washington, Durham). The scribe who has copied
  the second supplement to Le Manuel des Pechiez (ff. 86r-86v) has written a key for
  converting Latin script into runic script and an inscription in runes in the lower
  margin of f. 86v. Transliterated to Latin the runic inscription reads: ''nicholas
  . scripsit . haec . literam''. "'
