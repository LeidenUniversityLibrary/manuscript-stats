Notes: foliation is based on catalogue description and is therefore approximate; "On
  f. 144 b is the inscription "Usque satis," followed by a fancy signature, apparently
  Edm. Saunders [? Edmund Saunders, Chief Justice of the King's Bench 1683]. Belonged
  to [George Townshend, 2nd] Marquis of Townshend, and bought at his sale by [Thomas]
  Rod[d], from whom it passed (26 June, 1812, see f. 1 b) to C. Yarnold. At Yarnold's
  sale it was bought by Sir Thomas Phillipps (f. 4). "
