Notes: "This psalter was initially copied in Latin with a same-page Anglo-Norman translation.\
  \ In the sixteenth century, the Anglo-Norman side was scraped and an Icelandic version\
  \ was written over top it. The inscription on f.116r suggests that this was done\
  \ in Iceland: \"Endad(ur) \xCDhruna af gun(n)lagi io(n)s / syne \xFE(ann) 5 dag\
  \ martij an(no) do(mini) 1586\" (\"Finished in Hruni by Gunnlagur son of J\xF3n\
  \ on the 5th day of March AD 1586\"). For the transcription of this colophon and\
  \ its translation, I am grateful to Amos van Baalen and Dr. Thijs Porck"
