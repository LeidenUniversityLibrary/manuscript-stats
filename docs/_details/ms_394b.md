Notes: Composite MS, bound with 1 later (Latin) volume from 1428. "The presence (f.
  141v) of an inventory of ecclesiastical furnishings and vestments, followed by a
  list of masses celebrated at the shrine of Becket, both dated 1380, suggests that
  the third part of this composite manuscript was in possession of the guardians of
  the shrine at that time."
