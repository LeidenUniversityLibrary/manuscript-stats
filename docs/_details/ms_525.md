Notes: 'composite MS; date reflects date by which it was bound; "Possibly from the
  Benedictine cathedral priory of Durham (Wright, Fontes Harleiani, 1972, p. 142):
  a 15th-century inscription on f. 104r refers to donations from ''priore'', and various
  locations in Yorkshire and Durham: ''gisbouru'' (Guisborough, North Yorkshire),
  ''pocklyngton'' (Pocklington, East Yorkshire) and ''wessyngton'' (Washington, Durham).
  The scribe who has copied the second supplement to Le Manuel des Pechiez (ff. 86r-86v)
  has written a key for converting Latin script into runic script and an inscription
  in runes in the lower margin of f. 86v. Transliterated to Latin the runic inscription
  reads: ''nicholas . scripsit . haec . literam''. "'
