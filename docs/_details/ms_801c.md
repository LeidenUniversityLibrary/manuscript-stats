Notes: foliation for sermons is approximate ; flyleaf f.2 is prescriptions in French
  verse, then more prescriptions in prose (Dean no. 414) from s.xiii, including some
  English plant names and the end fly-leaf (s.xiii (2)) is part of a glossary of Latin
  and English plant names with a bit of French (Dean no. 314); "given to the monastery
  by Clement, rector of Chaddesley Corbet" who is attested in thirteenth-century records
  on account of having found himself in various legal and financial troubles ; exposition
  on the Lord's Prayer added "apparently in Clement's handwriting"
