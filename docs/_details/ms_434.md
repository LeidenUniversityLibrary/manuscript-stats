Notes: bound with other material added to the end; "middle of the 13th century, with
  additions to 2nd quarter of the 14th century"; 171r-171v has only a few words of
  French; "f. 202 (+ 2 unfoliated paper endleaves at the beginning and 2 at the end;
  2 unfoliated parchment endleaves at the beginning). Multiple series of foliation.
  The original order has been reconstructed by Vaughan, Matthew Paris, 1958, pp. 78-85,
  but note that shortly after the publication of this book, f. 120* was relabelled
  as f. 121 and all subsequent folios were renumbered, meaning that most references
  after this point must be increased by one to find the folio as now labelled.
