Notes: '" The fly-leaves (ff. 1, 344, 345), in a 15th cent hand in double columns,
  are from bk. ix (ch. 1-2, 6-8) of a compendium of religion and morals in French
  prose. This work, which is perhaps a translation of some Latin summa composed about
  the end of the 13th century, is partly preserved in Harley MS. 1310, ff. 1-80 b
