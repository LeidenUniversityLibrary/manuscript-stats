Notes: '"ff. 50-53 are bound separately" Contents and languages based on catalogue
  description and so uncertain; "This volume contains a chronicle, and several works
  composed by John of Wallingford, written in his own handwriting. He became a monk
  of Wallingford (between Oxford and Reading) in 1231, moved to St. Albans in 1246/7
  where he was in charge of the infirmary, and moved again c.1257 to Wymondham, a
  cell of St. Albans, where he died in 1258. Parts of the manuscript were written
  and illustrated while he was at St. Albans, but other parts date to the final year
  of his life, when he was at Wymondham, a few miles south-west of Norwich."'
