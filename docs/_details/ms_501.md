Notes: '"William of Winchester, Benedictine monk of the Reading abbey: probably assembled
  by him in c. 1265 (see Taylor 2002).The Benedictine abbey, Reading, co. Berkshire,
  in the diocese of Salisbury: references to the death of some of its abbots, in particular
  Abbot Simon (d. 1226) on 13 Feb., and Abbot John de Fornsett (d. 1261) on 19 Jan.
  (ff. 15v-16r): the death of the latter probably sets a ''terminus post quem'' for
  the manuscript, while the ''terminus ante quem'' is the death of Simon de Montfort,
  eighth earl of Leicester (c. 1208-1265), magnate and political reformer, at Evesham
  on 4 Aug. 1265 (see Taylor and Coates 1998)."'
