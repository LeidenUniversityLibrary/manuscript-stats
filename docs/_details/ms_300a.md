Notes: '"Part 1 was copied in England in the early- to mid-13th c. The Lucidaire en
  vers is also 13th c. (later than Part 1?), but there is nothing to link it with
  England. It is not known when the two codices were bound together.";" In the upper
  right corner of f. 1r can be read Sacre Eremi Camalduli J.C. W. 98."'
