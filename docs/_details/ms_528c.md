Notes: composite MS; "The last folio of this part contains what J. A. Herbert describes
  as a grant of land at Aldwinkle (in Northamptonshire) from Simon de Repindon to
  John de Aldewyncle and his wife Agnes, dating to July 5th, 1308 (128v)"  (may suggest
  lay ownership) ; this part contains verses on love in a 15th c hand (f. 128v) ;
  the first part contains the name of "Willelmus Smyth" (41v). "A different fifteenth-century
  hand wrote that the book belonged to Bury St Edmunds' and also copied a table of
  contents of the major parts (3r), which indicates that these were bound together
  by the fifteenth century"
