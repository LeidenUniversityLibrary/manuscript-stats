  by the 1670 fire and subsequently rebound with the original order of the folios
  much confused. This volume was possibly compiled by or for Walter de Norwich, cellarer
  and monk warden of the East Anglian estates c1304-1329 as much of the material pertains
  to the priory''s East Anglian estates and there is a lengthy discourse on the cellarer.";
  "fi. Covers from a service book with 4 line staves.;f1. Ch Ch''s contribution to
  the 1415 campaign." end points for Latin tracts are based on catalogue entries and
  therefore approximate'
