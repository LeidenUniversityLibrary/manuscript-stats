Notes: foliation, tracts and languages are based on catalogue description and are
  therefore approximate; "Added in the lower margin of each page in the Calendar (ff.
  I-6b) are I5th-cent. notes in English on the significance of thunder in the various
  months. Also added in the Calendar are the following obits:-(a) 20 jan., 'Obitus
  Thome Grene militis domini de Norton [Green's Norton, co. Northt.] qui obiit anno
  domini mcccel... [end illegible]', f. 1;-(b) 3 Feb., 'Obitus Ricardi Midilton uenerabilis
  annigeri', f. 1b;- (c) 10 Sept., 'Obitus Thome Grene militis dominus de Norton qui
  obiit anno domini millesimo cccclxiio', f. 5. Matilda, daughter of Sir John Throgmorton
  and widow of (c), married (b) as her second husband; (a) presumably refers to (c)'s
  father, who died in 1457-1458, see G. Baker, Hist. of Northampton, i, 1822-1830,
  P. 32. A note at f. 97b records the birth on 24 Mar. 1561 (cf. the erased entry
  in the calendar for that day) at Wavendon, co. Bucks., where the Green family owned
  lands, of Mary, daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Fitzhugh, afterw. wife of William
  Astrey, cf. V.C.H., Bucks., iii, P. 346; iV, Pp. 492, 495. The name of another member
  of the Fitzhugh family is scribbled in a 16th-cent. hand in the lower margin of
  f. 106. At the foot of f. 129b is a note by John Symonds Breedon (d. 1838), of Bere
  Court, Pangboume, co. Berks, recording his discovery of the MS. in a drawer in the
  china closet there, and adding that it was supposed to have been in the house since
  the times of Hugh Faringdon, last Abbot of Reading (executed 1539); this latter
  statement is probably no more than an inference from the fact that Bere Court was
  used as a country house by the Abbots of Reading (V.C.H., Berks, iii, P. 303)."
  Includes some A-N rubrics to Latin prayers (Dean no. 985)
