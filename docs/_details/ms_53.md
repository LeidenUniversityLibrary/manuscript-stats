Collection: Corpus Christi College
Folia: '169'
Headnote: Walter of Coventry (attrib.), Memoriale
Item: 39
Location: Cambridge
MS_Date: s.xiii (ex)
MS_ID: '53'
Notes: '"the first few leaves of the manuscript are taken up with a range of historical
  notes, extracts and genealogical tables, some relating to the archdiocese of York.
  The manuscript was almost certainly in the hands of the Tudor poet and antiquary
  John Leland (1506-1552), who thought it was in poor condition - ''Codex erat aliquot
  locis mancus''. The historian John Bale (1495-1563) saw the manuscript in Leland''s
  collection, but Parker must have acquired it some time before 1572 (possibly from
  the Cheapside resident William Carye), since the text was used as the basis for
  the archbishop''s Antiquitates published in that year. The manuscript was copied
  many time in the course of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
  the details it supplied about church government in Angevin England being keenly
  studied by church historians."'
