Notes: '"MS 66, as described by M. R. James, included half of a manuscript belonging
  to the Cistercian abbey of Sawley (Yorks.) and half of a manuscript belonging to
  the Benedictine abbey of Bury St Edmunds. The other two halves of the Bury and Sawley
  manuscripts are bound together as Cambridge, UL MS Ff. 1. 27. However, MS 66 has
  since been separated into MS 66 (Sawley MS) and MS 66A (Bury MS)"'
