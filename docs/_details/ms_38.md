  Library of Clare College."Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1905. ; http://mlgb3.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/mlgb/book/4803/'
Notes: couplet added (xiv, xv) on fol. 75v in Latin; end points for Latin tracts are
  based on James' entries and therefore approximate; "The name of the place where
  the Halimotae were held appears to be Tittenhanger (Herts.). This name and that
  of Wymundham occur in the text. Both places belonged to St Albans. It seems a fair
  inference that the MS is from St Albans library."
