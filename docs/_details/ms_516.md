Notes: '1 and 2 are flyleaves ; Sullivan writes that the manuscript is "written in
  three booklets by four co-operating scribes and probably originally bound as one
  volume." ; An early fourteenth-century note, described by Sullivan, refers to the
  Bishop of Durham (2r). A hand that Sullivan dates to the fifteenth century inscribed
  "John Dent" on a flyleaf (1v).  A Johannes Dent appears in a Yorkshire land dispute
  record from 1567, possibly the same John, or a relative.  '
