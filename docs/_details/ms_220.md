  at the end of the French conversation piece, "quod T amen pur charite B" (f. 35r).
  It is tempting to identify this T.B. with Thomas Burdette, the pensioner of Studley
  Priory, although there is no evidence that he studied law" (308);bound with 3 other
  gatherings of various dates; MS in private possession; languages of  items 2, 7,
