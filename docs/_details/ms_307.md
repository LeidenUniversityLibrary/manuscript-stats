  Decanus et Canonicus | Abbatisuille.

  The verso of 6, 7. is covered with twenty-six (closely written and contracted) lines
  of notes, followed by various scribblings, among which is the name: guillemus de
  courci, under which is: Memoriale Michaelis de sancto Bernhardo | apparatus Johannis
  monachi. Another name apparently is: henrici domini breknure...

  These writings seem all in XV. Cent. hands."'
