Notes: '"On f.i, ''Hic est liber monachorum claustralium Radingie''; and below, in
  a later hand, the number 83. The MS. was probably written in Reading Abbey, and
  passed (like other MSS. now in the Royal Library) to Henry VIII at the Dissolutio";
  "It is written in debased French, the prologues in particular being extraordinarily
  corrupt, according to Berger (op. Cit., p. 236); but the occasional insertion of
  English words, to which he refers, is not confined to the prologues, but occurs
  also in the text of the sacred books (e. g. ff. 91, 95 b, 127 b, 164, 168, I75 b,
  241 b). In some cases Latin words are inserted in explanation of the French (e.
  g. ff. 96, 181, 191); and in some cases words are omitted altogether, apparently
  from ignorance of the right French word (e. g. ff 74, 80, 161, 232, 288)."'
