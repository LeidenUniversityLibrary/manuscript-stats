The number generally corresponds with a manuscript’s position on the Index of MSS in Ruth Dean and Maureen Boulton’s Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts (1999). Where the MS_ID contains a letter, the MS_ID refers to a part of a larger composite manuscript (i.e. the modern form of the manuscript is composed of various parts that were copied separately in the medieval period). The letter indicates the position of the given part within the larger present-day manuscript, where ‘a’ is the first part, ‘b’ the second, etc."

Dates are based on those given by Dean except in rare cases in which the date in a catalogue entry was more reliable.  The following system has been adopted to express dates: s.xii (in) = beginning of the twelfth century; s.xii (1) = first half of the twelfth century; s.xii (med) = middle of the twelfth century; s.xii (2) = second half of the twelfth century; s.xii (ex) = late twelfth century; and s.xii / xiii = late twelfth century."
